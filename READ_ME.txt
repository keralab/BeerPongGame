Game Name & Description

3GC3 Beer Pong

Our final project simulates the popular party game ‘Beer Pong’. Each player’s goal is to toss their ball 
into an opposing player’s cups. If they are successful in tossing the ball into a cup, that cup is removed 
from play. When all of a player’s cups have been removed, they  lose the game. You can play as many rounds 
as you like; but, if you lose rounds, you will become more intoxicated, so it will be more difficult to 
properly throw your ball! 

While playing the game, the currently winning player will show his excitement through animation. 




Proposal - Final Product Discrepancies
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Our project proposal mentioned that we could bounce the cup into play. We found that it would be a more 
valuable usage of our time to make features that added more fun to the game. We opted instead to add
intoxication levels, which makes it very difficult to throw the ball. Plus, we added more depth into 
how the player targets & how they throw the ball. We use real projectile motion equations to find the
 impact point, and we added things such as a landing approximate, etc. Plus, we added menu screens and 
pause game functionalities. 

We thought modifying our features in this way gave a more close-to-real experience of playing the game, 
and made it more fun to play.
